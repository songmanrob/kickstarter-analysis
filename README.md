# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns - Challenge details at bottom
### Theater campaigns do well on Kickstarter
-In the US, the theater category boasts the largest number of successful Kickstarter campaigns

-Globally, campaigns that start around May are far more successful than those that start at other times of the year

### We also analyzed musical theater campaigns specifically
-While the average goal for a musical theater campaign is about $4000, the average funds raised are about $1000, with most being about $1500 or less
## Recommendation - Your best chance of success is to have a goal near $2000 and start your campaign in May.




### Challenge



![Challenge%20-%20Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Launch%20Date](https://github.com/songmanrob/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Challenge%20-%20Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Launch%20Date.png)
As shown in the chart above, more campaigns in the theater category found success when launched in May than any other month. Further analysis would have to be done to determine exactly why this is. More theater campaigns were launched in May than any other month so that may be a contributing factor. We could chart the success percentage by month to see. Also, I would also want to determine if other factors are involved such as the length of the campaign. Did successful campaigns launched in May run for a longer or shorter time than those launched in other months? Goal amounts could be another factor to consider, which we have done in an overall context in the Outcomes Based On Goals chart. We could break that down by month as well to see how the launch date figures into that data.

The chart above indicates that the most successful campaigns in the Plays subcategory had a goal under $5000. This makes sense given that lower goal amounts should be easier to reach. However, higher goal amounts between $35,000 and $45,000 were nearly as successful as those under $5000. What makes that a "sweet spot" when it comes to Play campaigns? I'd like to do further analysis as to why. Similar to our launch date analysis, there may be other factors involved such as length of campaign or launch date or previous successful campaigns by the same launcher. Curiously, none of the campaigns in the Plays subcategory were canceled. Those trying to fund plays on Kickstarter seem to be a group that sees things through till the end.
